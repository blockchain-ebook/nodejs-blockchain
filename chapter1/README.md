## Understanding Cryptocurrency

This chapter is a introduction to cryptocurrency as well as a quick guide for anyone without knowledge regarding bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies. We will use the word crypto interchangeable with term cryptocurrency in the rest of the book. 

### Crypto is a currency

"Crypto is a currency" sounds like a bold statement. But if you think of a more widely held belief,  "Crypto may not be currency," you may find it interesting. In fact, many of my friends, including myself, held the latter opinion to begin with, and took time to reach the former conclusion.

The law of inertia exists not only in the material world, but also in the cognitive world. The greater our experience is in existing knowledge, the greater the resistance to understanding new things. Especially brand new stuff without a buzzy, eye catching name and novel technology. (COMMENT: blockchain is definitely buzzy, eye catching, novel technology, so I don't know if we should keep that sentence.) It can be hard to imagine that the technology is a disruptive innovation that will change the world.

This is a simple, entry level article for those who have not been exposed to crypto in order to eradicate human misconceptions and explain the potential of crypto. This article is a success if you feel even a little excited and want to continue to explore and learn more.

This article covers some basic concepts including: What is crypto? How is it different from digital coins that people use every day? What are its advantages? Why they are so popular? Basically, it is about the basics from the perspective of a programmer.

### A simple history of Cryptocurrencies

Cryptocurrencies are a kind of digital currency. Before bitcoin appeared, "digital currency", "virtual currency", "electronic money" had already emerged, especially "virtual currency", which refers to  digitization or virtualization of “real”, “legal” currency, such as the US dollar and RMB, through online banking, alipay, etc, enabling people to pay without money.

Later, on the game platform, the concept of game currency was first put forward. Players used game currency to buy equipments. Then, websites launched various currencies to attract users. The most intuitive interpretation of those game currency, is actually "token".

In recent years, bitcoin, a real digital currency that can be called money, came out. However, people are reluctant to distinguish it from other forms of digital coins.  The law of inertia is at play here: people around the world have deep experiences using digital currency, so how is this any different?

The resistance of acceptance is huge: to understand cryptocurrency, one needs to have an understanding of P2P networks, cryptography, and databases, none of which are common knowledge.

Even if all of these technologies are understood, it is still not easy to replicate all the functions and features of a real currency.  In people's minds, they see "digital currency" as a “token” rather than a currency, so the statement "crypto is a currency" can be confusing indeed.

### What is cryptocurrency?

"Cryptocurrency" can be interpreted as an encrypted electronic money (or digital currency). A typical example is bitcoin. So let's use bitcoin to define crypto:

Crypto is a cryptographic digital currency based on a peer to peer network (P2P network), without a governing central institution and will usually have a limited fixed supply.

### Notes:

**(1) P2P network:** P2P networks have been around for a while. The first BitTorrent protocol we used was based on P2P network, which is supported by many download tools. Its advantage is "decentralization" - there is no central server, the files downloaded are all on independent computers, and the download speed is faster.

**(2) No central issuing institutions:** It is not controlled by a certain company, bank or state. This requires very complex mechanisms and rules in programming.

**(3) Fixed supply:** This is a strategy to ensure the value of Crypto. Rare items have more value - anything that is unlimited will lose its appeal. This is different from online community credits.

**(4) Encryption:** Encryption mentioned here is not access control such as user name or password, but transaction and transmission encryption. Cryptography theory might be complex, but it's easy to use.

**(5) Electronic currency:** Digital currency is money. Like legal currency, it can be traded freely. What about community credits? Are they currency? The answer is no, which will be explained in detail below.

### Crypto is a currency

The conclusion that crypto is a currency is much easier to grasp when we understand the history and concepts defined above. It can still be difficult for those who are not technologists. So let us compare it with fiat currency to find some shared characteristics.

**(1) Quantitative:** Legal currency is usually tied to the gold or to the GDP, which is relatively fixed (We do not want to discuss the excessive quantities insurance here). Crypto can be counted as an absolute fixed amount, or a small amount of additional issuance (which can make up for some lost currency, etc.) to prevent inflation.

However, some websites provide digital coins that have no fixed amount.

**(2) Encryption:** Legal currency has the physical security of the highest level of technology and can be verified through the counterfeit detector. The encryption found in crypto is the equivalent of anti-counterfeiting technology, and every transaction will be strictly encrypted. Cracking this encryption is theoretically possible, but not feasible financially, so it is even more difficult to counterfeit crypto. Verification of crypto is much simpler, quicker and more accurate than that of legal currency.

However, the digital currency of some individual websites is only a series of numbers, and the administrator can modify and freeze information, and their encryption is similar to permission control when the user logs in.

**(3) Transaction:** Legal currency, also known as currency or general equivalent, can be exchanged with any merchant and can be used to purchase anything, which is the most basic attribute of currency. The same is true for encrypted money, which you can pay to any party, and the encrypted money will arrive safely without fear of being hijacked, hacked, or reduced.


However, this is not true for the digital currency of some websites: they have no such function at all, and can only be traded within the website. Some stores can trade digital currency between many websites, but those websites belong to the same owner. Of course, a website can trade with other websites if it has an agreement with a third party to set the value of its digital currency, but the essence of this transaction is still legal currency. No one is likely to sign this agreement, at least not me, because there is no oversight, no control, no guarantee of absolute trust.

### Is Crypto Reliable?

From the discussion above, we understand how Crypto works, but we may still cast doubt on the usage of Crypto. Is it reliable? This is the first question that many people ask. The answer is yes, of course, but there are many techniques and theories involved to explain why. Fortunately, these technologies and theories are mature technologies. If you think they're reliable, the following explanation is easy to understand. Otherwise, it's hard to convince yourself that cryptocurrencies are different and more reliable than the digital money alternatives on some websites.

#### (1) Decentralization
It is easier to start with "centralization". Currently, all the major websites we visit are centralized, since we must have one or more servers to sort out the content we browse. If the server breaks down, no one will have access to either websites. In other words, centralization means that everything is controlled by an organization or company.

Decentralization, on the other hand, is based on P2P network, without any machine as the centralized server: every computer in the network is equal, and if anyone dropped down, the network will still continue. If everyone trusts the network, it will last forever, just like bitcoin networks. Specifically, please refer to the chapter with a sophisticated p2p network implementation".

This is a Crypto trading channel. A network foundation with barrier-free transactions. Anytime, anywhere, as long as you can access the Internet, you can get involved in this trading network and pay Crypto to any part of the world.

#### (2) Encryption and Decryption


We have free channels, but are we safe? How about if the channel get hacked?

This requires advanced encryption and decryption technology. Fortunately, encryption and decryption technology have been used in the Internet communities for years, and it is safe and solid. Theoretically, it is meaningless to decrypt and crack a single node and difficult to decrypt all nodes. Moreover, the number of P2P network nodes is huge, so the security level of Crypto currency system is very high.

This is the foundation of Crypto. With this tech, we can safely pay out the Crypto  without fear of losing or getting stolen, and the buyers can have the basic motivation to pay Crypto for transactions. For encryption and decryption technology, please refer to the chapters in "Encryption and decryption technology in node.js" and "three graphs to give you a comprehensive grasp of encryption and decryption technology".

#### (3) Blockchain

We can make the payment safely, but another concern comes. How can we guarantee that the seller has received it or not? What if the seller doesn't get paid? Who will guarantee this sense of trust?

The answer is Blockchain. This is the invention of the Crypto currency. It is the simple database technology. The essence of blockchain is that  transaction data is stored in a database, and its structure is that each record will record the hash value of previous record, so that we can trace back to the first block.


More importantly, the database, which is distributed across P2P networks, holds a copy of each node, and everyone can access it publicly and view the transaction records. In other words, not only can both parties see the transaction result, but the entire network can see it. It is open, transparent and traceable, so you have to believe it.

This is the credit guarantee of Crypto. No economic actions can be achieved without trust. This invention of Crypto opens a door for open, transparent and traceable credit system, and provide infinite possibilities for imagination by companies, organizations and individuals. Later, I will continue to share the code of the blockchain of Yishu, "the mysterious blockchain" (to be completed).


#### (4) Consensus Mechanism


Is it enough to only have security and credibility? Another problem is, since there are so many nodes in the same database, how can we decide which node’s writing should be accepted to maintain the blockchain data? Moreover, Crypto has a fixed amount of total currency, what if a node misbehave itself and increase the total amount?


The solution is "Consensus Mechanism", i.e. an algorithms mechanisms, including Proof of Work Mechanism (POW), Proof of Stack (POS), Delegated Proof of Stack (DPOS) etc, which is like the principle of collective decisions and rules in a discussion. This is where the coding focus for Crypto, and it is also the difficult part of Crypto development.

In particular, the DPOS mechanism is basically the shareholder voting mechanism of a joint-stock company, which is the algorithm mechanism used by Yishu. Later, I will continue to share articles, in "implementation of DPOS mechanism".

This is the operation rule of Crypto. It is the place where the previous common technologies are integrated and innovated. Without understanding this part, it is impossible to talk about Crypto development.

Finally, the above techniques are interdependent and mutual supported through consensus mechanism as a whole, and this ensures the absolute safety of payments and trades without issuing institutions.

### Conclusion

Imagine, what a highly autonomous network would bring us(future trend)? What can we do with Crypto (applications)? If you invest or start a business in this industry, what should you pay attention to (risk and methods)? Read the following passage: interests, the common goal of devil and angel. For answers.
