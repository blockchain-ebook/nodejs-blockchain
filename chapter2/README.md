## Preface
The topic of this chapter covers future trends, application scenarios, and risk alerts of blockchain, offering us a more intuitive understanding of some concepts in the blockchain world such as smart contracts.

## Profit governs human behavior

What do people live for? Sometimes we are ambitious and  enterprising while sometimes we are humble and desireless. But in the complex real world, we are always governed by certain force, unable to break, unable to stop.

This force is the desire to pursue interest. What is interest? The on-line explanation is:

Interest refers to the material and spiritual needs of people to satisfy desires including: money, power, lust, fame, status, etc. Interest comes with desire, which origins from human genes and inevitably generate: class, politics, conflicts... interest determines everything.

Pursuit of interests comes from human nature. Human beings have three natures: urging to survive, idle, and dissatisfied. Therefore, people's interests can also be divided into three categories, the interests of survival, the interests of laziness and the interests of dissatisfaction. In short, human desires are endless. We should take interest as the fundamental factor to analyze product development, which makes it easier to understand why people are so desperate for cryptocurrencies.

## Programmable "interests" transfer means

(1) Credit is the basis of transactions
When will we get to "credit"? When will you check the "credit" of others? Obviously, it's when you're ready to "trade" with someone. Credit is the premise of trading.

Economic society is a credit society. Without credit, everything will return to primitive society: barter, even self-sufficiency. If trading risks are great enough, people would give up trading to protect his/her own interests (the nature of survival) and to maximize individual interests (the nature of dissatisfaction). Credit is equally important as business itself.

(2) Credit is a process of accumulation
The establishment of credit is not a matter of time. Security, openness and traceability are the basic elements of human trust. No one trust others on the first sight, and no one can win others' trust when he/she is hiding.

The implication here is that everyone will build a "blockchain" in their own minds about the others’ credit. Once there is a transaction, we will consciously recall our experiences and evaluate the risk of the current transaction. If it's a big deal, the person may also consult a third party for further verification through “blockchain” of others.

(3) The essence of credit is to solve information asymmetry
Economics is based on an assumption: "people are rational and selfish", that is, all economic behaviors will sail towards "maximization of benefits". People can't trust you in the first place because they are "asymmetric in information" and don't have enough information to prove that they won't be "sacrificed" in your "maximization of interest".

"Information asymmetry" is manifested in three aspects: you don't know my information; you know my information but you can't identify it;you know and identify my information, but you can't control it.

Some economists conclude that information asymmetry is the main cause of market trade imbalance, it affects the social fairness, justice and market allocation efficiency. They put forward a variety of solutions, which still cannot solve the problem completely.

It wasn't until bitcoin came out that people found a way to solve this problem. Why is bitcoin so popular that everyone believes that it's valuable? Because it's absolutely believable (at least for now)! Why it is absolutely credible? Because the combination of blockchain, crypto and distributed networks makes transactions secure, public, and traceable. (see last article for more information).

Therefore, the blockchain carries credit, which does not rely on government, bank or consortium mortgage guarantee. Without government guarantees, legal currency would be worthless. Without the blockchain, bitcoin would be worthless. The value of the blockchain is the reason that bitcoin and true cryptos are so popular.

In other words, program-based transactions of crypto are based on certain rules, and people who respect the rules will benefit, so the ultimate result is that more people shall try to be involved, making this network bigger and bigger. That's the result of bitcoin: as people predicted that it would die, actually it was more and more popular.


## The future trend

Before bitcoin, human beings can never fully control "interest" flow. With bitcoin, people can program the "interest" flow, and this will bring infinite possibility.

Decentralization, the basic form of human society, is the premise of individual exchange. It is not about how advanced the technology is, but how backward the existing technology is. P2P, encryption and decryption, distributed database and all other technologies are designed to solve certain problems at a certain stage. Together, they become crypto, which is closer to the origin.


Everything that goes against humanity will be overturned. People want freedom. It is never pleasant to leave your fate at the mercy of a third party. Therefore, lots of centralized  applications will gradually come to an end, sooner or later.


Those decentralized applications are will be the mainstream as they follow humanity. It is not important if it is Bitcoin or other Cryptos as long as it allows you to exchange information, money and wealth without any obstacles.


Bitcoin offers us a sample for the new world. The new era of the Internet has come although still immature. At this moment, all apps, like the original BP, cell phone or smartphone, are still so ideal that they can only be used as toys and experiments for a small number of people. But soon, it will cover over the world.

## Application scenarios

Our goal is to develop products with blockchain technology, so it is helpful to understand its application scenarios. In summary, this technology can be applied in the following aspects:

**(1) Transfer & payment**

This should be the most basic function, many cryptos such as bitcoin are created to delimish third party payment, so they are naturally applied to transfer, pay and borrow money. In particular, once crypto can be exchanged directly, there should be no independent third-party payment institutions in the future.

**(2) Fund settlement**

The structure of the blockchain is a good settlement system. As its network is spreading all over the world, cross-border payment and settlement are also becoming easy. The current banking settlement system is very complex because almost all institutions have their own accounting systems. Therefore, many institutions adopted “alliance chain” and introduced the blockchain technology, thus greatly reducing the settlement cost and duration. Globally, it is expected that the application of blockchain to B2B cross-border payments and settlement will reduce the cost of each transaction from about $26 to about $15.

**(3) Smart contract**

Smart contract is the trend. Its main features include: the contract terms are untamable; the validity is guaranteed; the process is transparent and open for supervision; the execution is programmable automatic without interference. Therefore, it will reform future contracts and promote a more open and fair society.

**(4) Identity authentication**

User authentication and recognition is the essential means to avoid illegal commercial behaviors, Banks have to invest continuously to strengthen their credit audits and customer credit investigation. Blockchain technology can promote the standardization of user identity data requirements, ensure data security and information sharing, and reduce duplicated audits. It is estimated that applying blockchain to identity authentication can save 3-5 billion dollars per year.

**(5) E-commerce**

Large e-commerce sites involve warehousing, logistics, transactions, and payments, and each step requires a lot of collaboration and fund settlement. Especially in the payment link, it is currently based on a centralized payment system with a third party. It has problems with bank funds being slow and vulnerable to various types of hacking. By using blockchain technology, through multiple signatures, it is possible to simply abandon third parties and realize direct payment between users and merchants, which greatly reduces the operating costs and operational risks of e-commerce websites, and also improves the security of user payment.

**(6) Copyright protection**

Digital publishing piracy, online novels, online games, music, video, pictures and other resources are freely distributed without authorization, and the related creators and operating agencies directly suffer huge losses, which has hit the creation of outstanding authors. Passion increases the operating costs of operating agencies and hinders the innovative development of human knowledge. Many music artists, photographic artists, and online literature writers turn to blockchains, use blockchain technology to secure digital publications, accept readers and users more directly, and use smart contracts to automatically resolve licensing issues for artists. Establish a more direct interaction with the user. Billion books are dedicated to the digital publishing industry, and strive to create an upstream and downstream ecosystem, adding new impetus to human creation.

**(7) Securities trading**

Stocks and other securities transactions have a long settlement time. If blockchain technology is introduced, the time interval between stock trading days and delivery days can be reduced from 1-3 days to 10 minutes, the efficiency and controllability of transactions are improved, and the risk of trading behavior is reduced. At the same time, the transaction party identity, transaction volume and other information are recorded in the blockchain in real time, which is beneficial to the securities issuer to improve decision-making efficiency, but also facilitates regulatory maintenance and reduces black-box operations. According to experts, the global application of blockchain to the clearing and settlement of cash securities can save more than $10 billion a year in the industry, while removing a lot of extra money in the areas of foreign exchange, commodities and OTC derivatives. cost.

**(8) Trade Finance**

Traditional supply chain financial or trade finance business processes are highly dependent on labor, including a large number of review and verification of transaction documents and paper documents. Not only are the labor costs high, but the risks of mistakes in each link are also high. If you manage on distributed ledgers, These processes can reduce labor and other costs, improve efficiency and transparency, and reduce the risk of fraud and manual work errors. Professional organizations expect global use of blockchains in supply chains or trade finance to generate $17 billion to $20 billion in value annually for financial institutions and buyers and sellers.

**(9) Internet of Things and Big Data**

The main features of the Internet of Things and Big Data are distributed, so it is also very suitable to use blockchain technology. Through blockchain technology, distributed systems such as IoT, big data, cloud storage, etc., each node is highly autonomous and intelligently coordinated with each other. Since there is no central control system to identify each other, the node will be able to independently and independently Contact, manage software updates, software errors or control energy consumption, and synergy is enhanced. At the same time, security is strengthened, and it is not easy to cause systemic damage and large-scale loss of data.
