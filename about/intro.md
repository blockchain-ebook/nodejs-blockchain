# Introduction

This book can be used as an introductory book of the application of Node.js to develop blockchain, as well as the reference document for Yishu(and Lisk,with Crypti core platform).

The source code that this book shares is Ebookcoin (Yishu coin), which is a powerful motivation of Yishu. Just like Lisk (raising more than $6.5 million), Yishu is an independent branch of Crypti (no longer under maintenance) and has sidechain function similar to Ethereum, which can carry a variety of decentralized applications. Therefore, no matter if you are studying Crypti, Lisk, Ebookcoin, or Node.js, this book is worthy of reference.

The goal of Yishu is to create decentralized software for everyone and promote the sharing of human knowledge. 

Writing this book is also sharing the best practice for Yishu. Yishu is simple and fast in writing and publishing. The article is currently free on github and http://bitcoin-on-nodejs.ebookchain.org.
